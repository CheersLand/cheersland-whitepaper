# CheersLand Overview
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/1.png)
CheersLand is an expandable GameFi universe where anyone can monetize their gaming experiences and social networks. CheersLand GameFi Universe is composed of multi-game combinations, Ranking List, Initial Gaming Offering (IGO), NFT Market, Multi-asset Staking Platform, etc..

In CheersLand, gamers can earn rewards through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. This Play to Earn mode is adopted by Axie Infinity, My Neighbor Alice, Alien Worlds, etc., which caused enthusiastic response and commercial success in GameFi.

Game builders are allowed to use CheersLand API to launch their own games in CheersLand GameFi Universe and share the economic model. This new model has been dubbed Build to Earn and will inspire game builders to earn rewards by expanding the game scenes for CheersLand.

The first classic game, Crypto Pirates, has been launched on CheersLand and verified its business model while still in early access.

Gamers will be able to get the rankings on the leaderboard by constantly passing levels in the game. CheersLand will take a snapshot of Ranking List every week and reward users who rank on it.

### The weekly prizes are including but not limited to:
- CHEERS tokens
- Allocations of the projects listed on IGO channel
- Multi-asset airdrops
- NFTs of in-game items

The gamified launchpad for startups is named Initial Gaming Offering (IGO), which will provide a portion of allocations of startups to gamers on Ranking List. 

Gamers are free to buy and sell NFTs of in-game items on NFT Market.

Therefore, IGO and NFT Market provide CheersLand with expandable GameFi scenes.

In addition to Crypto Pirates, other games based on CheersLand will adopt the same business model and mechanism, which will help gamers earn continuous passive income.

All users who contribute to the ecosystem, including gamers, game builders, stakers, investors, will be rewarded CHEERS, the native token, which represents a real slice of CheersLand GameFi Universe as it has governance rights and fee sharing built into it. This blockchain economic design is the key difference between CheersLand and other traditional game platforms.

### The Vision

We want to redefine a more cheerful world with GameFi.

By creating more economic opportunities for users, CheersLand will make a difference. We hope to bring millions of Internet users into the blockchain through CheersLand and experience the GameFi revolution together.

Now, let's do it.


# Features

We are pleased to see that GameFi has detonated the crypto market.

Projects such as Axie Infinity, My Neighbor Alice and Alien Worlds have successfully improved crypto users' enthusiasm for paying attention to GameFi, but this is far from enough.

We firmly believe that the innovative gameplay of GameFi, which integrates NFT and Metaverse, will expand the boundaries of the crypto world.
But any game product will inevitably have the duration from popular to obsolete.

The game product's life can be extended only by frequently upgrading the game features and powering the ecosystem through attracting more new players.

Therefore, we focus on the exploration of how to establish a sustainable and healthy business model in the GameFi field, which is also the goal of CheersLand.

CheersLand is dual-driven in Play to Earn mode and Build to Earn mode, with the product portfolio of Gamified Launchpad, Multi-game Universe, Multi-asset Staking Platform and NFT Market, and powered developing new users by the invitation mechanism, which builds a unique and diversified GameFi ecosystem.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/2.jpg)
# Gameplay

In order for CheersLand to quickly enter the efficient operation phase, we choose Classic Mini Games as the prioritized type of games for launch.

Classic Mini Games have a broad user base at any age around the world, and allow players to play the game at any time and anywhere with no barriers to participation.

This is the reason why we chose to use the GameFi business model to power Classic Mini Games and we want to pay tribute to the classics. All games based on 

CheersLand will adopt similar business models and gameplay.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/3.jpg)

## The general concepts in the games are as follows:

### HP:
Health Point (HP) is the universal ticket for the Cheersland Multi-game Universe. Gamers can play all games based on CheersLand if they have HPs and spend 1 HP for once play.

There are two ways for players to earn HP:
- Use the exclusive invitation link generated by CheersLand to invite friends to visit CheersLand.
- Participate in staking on Multi-asset Staking Platform.

### Scores:

Scores are the core indicators for evaluating the gaming ability of the players.

The smart contract of CheersLand will automatically record the player's scores in the game. Different games will adopt different scoring formulas. Taking Crypto Pirates as an example, the scoring formula is:
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/4.png)

### Ranking List:

Ranking List is the leaderboard sorted by the games' scores. The current rankings only show the top 100, which means the scarcity of seats.

Ranking List can reflect the engagement of gamers to a certain extent. It is an effective way to rank and screen users, and also an important indicator for evaluating user value to the network. It is worth mentioning that the ranking will be dynamically changed and updated at all times, which means that all gamers will always be in competition.

### Weekly Tournaments：
We can see that Ranking List can screen out valuable GameFi users for the CheersLand ecosystem, and it will be very meaningful to motivate them. Weekly Tournaments, titled by the sponsors, will take a weekly snapshot of the leaderboard and reward the gamers on the list for their engagement. CheersLand will provide diversified prizes by attracting external sponsors and internal ecological benefits.

### The gameplay of CheersLand is generally as follows:
- Gamers need to spend HPs to participate in the games to get scores as good as possible.
- Gamers can earn more HPs through staking or inviting friends to visit CheersLand.
- Ranking List will show the top 100 gamers based on their scores.
- The gamers listed on the leaderboard will have the chance to earn rewards every week.
- The rewards are including but not limited to CHEERS tokens, airdrops from other sponsors, whitelisted allocations of Initial Gaming Offering (IGO), and NFTs.

As for non-game users, they are also allowed to participate in staking on CheersLand to earn rewards or HPs, and invest in the IGO of startups listed on CheersLand as well.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/5.jpg)
# Multi-game Universe
CheersLand is a multi-game universe where gamers can monetize their gaming experiences and social network.

Health Point (HP) as the universal ticket is able to be used within the Cheersland Multi-game Universe, which means gamers can play all games based on CheersLand if they have HPs and spend 1 HP for once play.

CheersLand designed Play to Earn mode and Build to Earn mode, forming a complete incentive scheme for CheersLand Multi-game Universe.

Play to Earn mode allows gamers to have chances to earn rewards for long term in CheersLand Multi-game Universe. In addition, gamers can earn extra HPs by inviting friends to visit CheersLand to get more chances to win the games and accrue value to the network. Gamers benefit from their social network, which guarantees the continuous supply of CheersLand user sources.

Build to Earn mode will inspire and attract game builders to create and launch high-quality and diverse game works based on CheersLand. This guarantees the supply of multi-game scenes.

According to the roadmap, CheersLand will release at least one game every quarter. In the early stage, the CheersLand team will participate in game development and operation as game builders. As the community grows, it will ultimately be up to the community to decide the release of the games.

CheersLand launched the first Classic Mini Game, Crypto Pirates, based on the principle of simplicity and ease to play, and it's in early access. Click here to read the gameplay of Crypto Pirates.

The CheersLand team plans to launch Click Click, Gold Miner, Block Builder and other classic games in the next few quarters.

**The advantages of multiple-game combinations are as follows:**
- Satisfy the preferences of multiple user groups
- Relieve the fatigue of players and enhance User Stickiness
- Resonate between games with common in-game items
- Provide more commercial scenarios
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/6.png)
# Invitation Mechanism
Players must spend HPs to play the game. Owning more HPs means that the player will have more chances to pass the levels in the game, which will more likely cause a better ranking for the player.

In order to bring more players to participate in CheersLand Multi-game Universe, we designed an invitation mechanism:

When the user clicks the Invite Friends button, CheersLand will generate an exclusive link based on the user's blockchain address. Once other users visit CheersLand through the exclusive link and authorize the contract to confirm the invitation relationship, both the host and guest will increase 1HP for the game. Therefore, everyone will be powered by his social network in CheersLand.

The Invitation Contract developed by the CheersLand team will record the user's invitation data and calculate HPs. Now it's live on Binance Smart Chain and will integrate other blockchains in the future.

The contract owner has the authority to modify the maximum amount of invitations. Since it is still in the early access stage, we set the maximum amount of invitations to 10 for each user.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/7.jpg)
# Multi-asset Staking
The CheersLand team has completed the development of the Staking Contract, allowing players to stake tokens on Multi-asset Staking Platform to earn HPs.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/8.png)
### The rules are as follows: 
- Users choose any asset that has been listed on Multi-asset Staking Platform for staking. 
- There are restrictions on the staking minimum of the tokens. For example, 0.1 BNB is the staking minimum if you choose to stake BNB. 0.2 or 0.3 BNB are also acceptable.
- The staking duration is 24 hours, and users will be able to claim tokens staked once it ends.
- The more you stake, the more HPs you will earn. For example, Stake every 0.1 BNB for 24 Hours, then you will earn an extra HP. Similarly, you will earn 2 HPs if you stake 0.2 BNB. 
- Staking multi-asset is acceptable, which means that users are free to stake all kinds of tokens listed on Multi-asset Staking Platform at the same time. The contract will record them all.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/9.jpg)
Multi-asset Staking, as one of the important features of the CheersLand ecosystem, originally realizes the business model of Staking to Play and Earn. Multi-asset Staking also provides gamified token use cases for holders and stakers of other crypto projects to activate their engagement, and attract them to the GameFi Universe and accrue value to the network.

Currently, Multi-asset Staking Platform supports all assets on Binance Smart Chain and will integrate other blockchains in the future. In the next stage, Various staking products with different staking caps, different staking durations and different prizes will be launched to provide users with more options.

# Play to Earn
The Play to Earn mode is adopted by Axie Infinity, My Neighbor Alice, Alien Worlds, etc., which caused enthusiastic response and commercial success in GameFi. So in CheersLand, Play to Earn mode has been used as an engine for the economy.

Different from other GameFi projects, Play to Earn mode in CheersLand has made three improvements:

### No Entry Barrier
All games based on CheersLand will support running on multiple clients so gamers can play the games at any time and anywhere. In CheersLand, all users can participate in games at zero cost, and earn rewards directly through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem.

Taking Crypto Pirates as an example, every new gamer will have 2 HPs at the beginning, which means that gamers will be able to play the game twice. Once the gamers' HP is 0, they can still choose to invite friends or stake tokens to earn HPs and continue to play the game.

### Hit the Rankings
Ranking List is the leaderboard sorted by the games' scores, which reflects the engagement of gamers to a certain extent.

Gamers listed on the leaderboard must be active users of CheersLand, as well as experienced players of GameFi. CheersLand will reward gamers on Ranking List every week, so gamers only need to focus on playing the game to get better rankings, and they can benefit from CheersLand all the time.

But at the same time, the rankings will be dynamically changed and updated at all times, which means that all gamers will always be in competition.

### Diversified Prizes
CheersLand will provide diversified prizes as rewards for gamers. Weekly Tournaments will be hosted and titled by the sponsors in CheersLand as a regular programme.

### The weekly prizes are including but not limited to:
- CHEERS tokens
- Allocations of the projects listed on IGO channel
- Multi-asset airdrops
- NFTs of in-game items
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/10.jpg)
# IGO
The gamified launchpad for startups is named Initial Gaming Offering (IGO) in CheersLand, one of the important features of CheersLand GameFi Universe.

Startups can submit project information to apply for IGO. In the early stage, the CheersLand team will serve as the main jury to evaluate the projects and decide whether to list their IGOs.

In late 2021, the Community Vault will be established and CHEERS holders will be able to decide whether to list the IGO in the application through governance voting.

In addition to raising capitals for startups through IGO, CheersLand can also provide them with advertising and promotion services in the game.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/11.jpg)

The tokens of startups will also be listed on Multi-asset Staking Platform and gamers will be allowed to stake the tokens to earn Health Points (HPs).

All listed startups will be required to pay **marketing fees** to CheersLand, which will become part of revenue streams of the ecosystem.

The allocations of the IGO projects will be conditionally distributed to whitelisted users. Part of the whitelist will be allocated to eligible tokens stakers like users who stake at least 10,000 CHEERS in the pool.

The other part of the whitelist is allocated to the gamers on Ranking List. They have active engagement and experience as GameFi users. Their participation will be helpful to the establishment of the project at early stage.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/12.jpg)

# NFT Market
We have seen that many crypto projects have used Non-Fungible Token (NFT) in the GameFi field. In the CheersLand ecosystem and business model, NFT will also play a very important role.

According to the roadmap of CheersLand, NFT Market Beta for trading will be launched in Q4 of 2021, after the launch of the second Classic Mini Game.

Game builders are the creators of NFTs in early access, and they are also the builders of the Multi-game Universe.

CheersLand will provide NFT Mint tools for game builders to tokenize the game items used in the ecosystem and list them on the NFT Market for trading.

NFT assets in CheersLand include Pass Card, VIP Seat, LP Miner and other in-game items, some of which can be staked to farm in Multi-asset Staking Platform. Also they will be taken to Weekly Tournaments as optional rewards.

As the NFT Market grows, some gamers on Ranking List will be allowed to mint and list NFTs for trading as the creators under the standards of CheersLand.

In the NFT Market, CHEERS will be accepted as universal currency to measure and calculate the value of NFTs.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/13.jpg)
CheersLand NFT Market will take **resale royalties** and **service fees**. Resale royalties are used to incentivize NFT creators, which are initially set to 10%. The initial service fees are set to 1%, and a portion of all NFT Market service fees will be shared with the CheersLand Community Vault. Eventually both resale royalties and service fees will be decided by CHEERS holders through governance voting.

# Build to Earn
As we know, CheersLand is structured as an open-ended and expandable GameFi platform. Crypto Pirates launched on CheersLand has proven the feasibility of the business model now. So a large number of excellent game works will be accepted and launched on CheersLand to build the CheersLand ecosystem based on the successful model.

The Build to Earn mode is a kind of incentive mechanism designed for game artists, dev teams and companies, and we collectively refer to them as game builders here. **The principles are as follows:**
- Bring excellent and classic games to the blockchain.
- Diversify games in the CheersLand ecosystem.
- Help game builders monetize their gaming experiences and work in the blockchain field.

According to the roadmap, CheersLand Application Programming Interface, aka CheersLand API will be launched in early 2022, including HP Record interface, Scores Record interface,  Invitation Contract interface, Staking Contract interface, Raking List interface, etc., which will be shared with game builders.

Game builders integrate the APIs to upgrade the game works and apply for launch on CheersLand. Once approved, it will be supported by the CheersLand GameFi community. CheersLand will also provide NFT Mint tools for game builders to tokenize the game items used in the games and list them on the NFT Market for trading. Game builders will enjoy the revenue sharing through the whole model.

CheersLand has 5% of total CHEERS supply as rewards for the Build to Earn mode in order to attract enough participants to accrue value to the network, which will be gradually unlocked according to the development of the Multi-game Universe.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/14.jpg)
# CHEERS Tokenomics

CHEERS is the native utility token of CheersLand GameFi Universe.

CHEERS is the glue that binds all ecosystem and community members of CheersLand together, which acts as the incentive and ticket for supporting the ecosystem. CHEERS holders will be able to claim rewards if they stake their tokens, play the game, build the game, and participate in Initial Gaming Offering (IGO) and key governance votes.

**The use cases of CHEERS are as follows:**

### Staking

CHEERS stakers, as an identity in the CheersLand ecosystem, will earn CHEERS rewards and farm multi-assets on CheersLand.

### Governance

By governance voting, CHEERS holders will have an influence on the crucial aspects of CheersLand development such as staking yield, projects listing on IGO, games onboard, buyback & burn percentage etc..

### Incentive
CHEERS will act as the main incentive for gamers participating in Weekly Tournaments and Ranking List, as well as builders participating in the development of games based on CheersLand.

### Ticket
CHEERS will be used to determine eligibility for participation in Initial Gaming Offering (IGO) or certain sales/auctions conducted by the CheerLand team.

### Payment
CHEERS will be accepted as universal currency within CheerLand NFT Market. Commodities in the ecosystem will be priced and traded with CHEERS as the unit.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/15.jpg)

CHEERS is designed to align the incentives between the gamers and the builders in positive ways. **There are three main goals of the mechanism:**
- To reward gamers for interacting with CheersLand while incentivizing them to hold CHEERS tokens so they can claim additional rewards.
- To connect to the ecological revenue and allow gamers and builders to benefit from it.
- To decentralize the ownership and governance of CheersLand.

In late 2021, the Community Vault will be established and begin to receive revenues generated by CheersLand, which will be governed by CHEERS holders eventually, once the network has become sufficiently decentralized. It is worth mentioning that CHEERS holders will enjoy a decreasing inflation model additionally boosted by buyback & burning mechanisms fueled by the ecological revenue.

## The Community Vault receives inflows from:
- Portion of revenues from Initial Gaming Offering (IGO)
- Portion of revenues from Multi-asset Staking Platform
- Portion of all NFT Market service fees
- Portion of marketing and advertising revenue

CHEERS holders will decide and modify the proportion of inflows through governance voting. More streams will be added in the future from NFT sales, gaming licensing fees, and more as new opportunities present themselves.

# Allocation
The distribution of $CHEERS tokens is shown in the following table:
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/16.png)
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/17.png)
As time passes, all allocations that initially are managed by the CheersLand team and foundation will be integrated into the CheersLand DAO and CHEERS holders will be able to vote on decisions about using them. These allocations are something that could potentially be decided by governance over time.

# Token Sale
CheersLand is planning to raise $2,385,500 in token sale of CHEERS to strategic investors and launchpads. **The details are as follows:**
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/26.png)
# Unlock Schedule
CHEERS will be unlocked in a predetermined schedule which lasts for 64 months from the public sale. The initial circulating supply is set to 8,520,000 CHEERS - 8.52% of the total supply.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/19.png)
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/20.png)
The above chart illustrates the maximum possible issuance of CHEERS tokens over the coming years, and the total supply will never exceed 100,000,000. Through the development of the ecosystem and the distribution of CHEERS, CheersLand will gradually evolve into a community-owned decentralized organization with the ownership becoming less concentrated over time.

# Usage of Fund Raised
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/21.png)
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/22.jpg)
The CheersLand team will prepare yearly statements that include a high-level overview of what the funds have been used for to make the usage clear. The framework for spending is currently being drafted and is expected to be ready by late 2021.

**The principles for the usage of fund raised are as follows:**
- Clear value added to the CheersLand community.
- KPIs and goals that unlock funds (if applicable).

# Revenue Streams
CheersLand runs the Game-as-a-Service model with GameFi as the core, where new features will be introduced over time.

The main revenue streams of CheersLand are spread over Initial Gaming Offering (IGO)  service fees, ads and marketing fees, multi-asset staking charge, NFT item sales and NFT Market service fees.

According to the roadmap IGO service fees and marketing fees will be the primary revenue in the CheersLand ecosystem once users enter the growth phase. So we will pay close attention to the key metrics and data of Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users on CheersLand.

We will have more in-game items of NFT for sales as additional revenue in the future. Besides, we will charge a portion of NFT Market service fees taken from successful sales of CheersLand NFT assets: Pass Card, VIP, and other items once the CheersLand NFT Market launched.

The Community Vault will be built and begin to accumulate fees in late 2021 once the network has become sufficiently decentralized. All the fees and revenue generated by CheersLand will be placed in the Community Vault which is governed by the CHEERS holders.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/cheersland+pic/23.jpg)
# Technology

## Multichain
We initially chose Binance Smart Chain due to its powerful ecosystem and the ability to recruit initial community members. So we deployed the first classic game, Crypto Pirates, on BSC to verify the business model we designed.

When the operation of Crypto Pirates enters a stable stage, the CheersLand team will develop and launch more classic games such as Click-Click, Block Builder and Gold Farmer etc..

In order to allow users of different blockchains to interact with CheersLand GameFi Universe, Cheersland will be deployed in various potential blockchains and eventually operated on multichain environments.

To date, **the product matrix built on the CheersLand is as follows:**
- Initial Gaming Offering (IGO) platform.
- Multi-asset Staking platform.
- Classic games ‌including Adventure Games (AVG), Puzzle Games (PZL) and Mini Games etc..
- CheersLand API for game builders.

We estimate that the game module program based on CheersLand will be launched in 2022, which will provide game builders with simple and easy-to-use API, and truly power their games with blockchain. This is exactly the Build to Earn mode we designed. 

We believe that CheersLand GameFi Universe can make the gamers realize Play to Earn, which will also become a powerful platform for attracting developers to blockchain technology and GameFi.
![CheersLand](https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/grant/p11-tech.jpg)

## Anti-cheating Mechanism
In order to guarantee the fairness of the game, we have designed an anti-cheating mechanism. Taking Crypto Pirates as an example, the anti-cheating mechanism mainly consists of the following four points:

### Auth Token
When the user connects the wallet address, a time-sensitive token will be automatically generated to restrict the login environment and prevent the bot from running game scripts.
### Timing Window Algorithm
While the gamer touches in-game items to get scores, it will be recorded as a state. It will be considered cheating once the interval between the two states is too short. This feature is added to avoid running game scripts.
### Distance Window Algorithm
Once the user's in-game coordinate shifts too far in a short period of time, it will be considered cheating. The addition of the feature will avoid running game scripts.
### Non-gaming Operation Blocking
While the user clicks on the pause button, sponsored ad pages will be displayed full screen, which prevents the user from using pause time to consider how to pass the levels. Also it prevents users from using screenshot tools to cheat in the game.

## Audit
The Invitation and Staking Contract of CheersLand has been audited by Solidity Finance team on August 5th, 2021. Read the audit report [here](https://solidity.finance/audits/CheersLand/).
Before the new feature is released, we will first complete internal audits and third-party audits, and will regularly re-audit all contract code to ensure its security.
